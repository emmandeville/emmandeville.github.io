    <h1>Floating trash collector has setback in Pacific Garbage Patch</h1>
    <h2>By Laura Parker</h2>

    <p>
      The campaign to rid the world’s oceans of plastic trash marked a turning point last September as a giant, floating trash-collector steamed out of San Francisco on a mission to clean up the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.</p>
    <p>
      Over the course of the next year, the device will undergo the ultimate tests and face some tough questions: Can technology prevail over nature? Did the engineers at The Ocean Cleanup in the Netherlands invent the first feasible method for extracting large amounts of plastic debris from the sea? Or will the wilds of the open Pacific tear it to shreds, turning the cleaner itself into plastic trash? Alternately, even if a Pacific storm does not devour the device, will it attract marine animals such as dolphins and turtles and fatally entangle them?
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t think it’s going to work, but I hope it does,” says George Leonard, the Ocean Conservancy’s chief scientist. “The ocean needs all the help it can get.” The project is the creation of Boyan Slat, a 24-year-old Dutch college dropout who raised more than $30 million on a five-year quest to build an ocean-cleaning machine. His inspiration dates to a holiday diving trip in Greece he took as a teenager, where he encountered so much plastic, he decided to make cleaning up the ocean his mission. Back home in the Netherlands, he quit his aerospace engineering studies at the Delft University of Technology and founded the nonprofit Ocean Cleanup, where he is now CEO with a staff of 65 engineers and scientists.

      The praise for Slat's effort so far has been lavish and the criticism harsh. He has won accolades from the King of Norway, a top environmental award from the United Nations, and his name appears on various lists, including one by Forbes magazine, of rising young entrepreneurial leaders. He has also been taken to task by scientists for under-estimating the potential risks to marine life the device will create.

      Miriam Goldstein, director of ocean policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal-leaning Washington think-tank, and a long-time critic of the project, says the cleaning device can mimic a fish aggregating device, known as FADs and used by fishermen to draw ocean-going fish to a central area where they can be easily caught. As fish congregate at the device, they could then attract marine animals and become entangled. “Any time you have a floating object in the ocean of any reasonable size, fish like to congregate under it,” she says. “It’s definitely going to become a FAD. It’s not inherently bad for fish to gather, but it’s also not known what effect that will have.”
    </p>
    <p>More fundamentally, some say the project diverts attention away from what is regarded as a more cost-effective, consequential way to save the oceans—by preventing plastic trash from flowing into it in the first place. “What’s floating on the surface of the ocean gyres is only three percent of the plastics that enters the ocean every single year,” says Eben Schwartz, marine debris program manager for the California Coastal Commission. “I understand why people are fascinated by this bright, shiny new object. But it’s sort of a digital solution to an analogue problem. The solution to plastic pollution entering our ocean starts on land.”
    </p>
    <p>The Ocean Cleanup’s engineering team has been assembling the device in Alameda, California, for a year. On Saturday, it will be towed out into international waters off California for a final round of testing, and then towed to the garbage patch, arriving in mid-October for what is a planned year-long deployment.
    </p>
    <p>Plastic trash accumulates in ocean gyres, which are large systems of circular currents. The Pacific Garbage Patch, which collects in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, is the largest and best-known assemblage of floating trash. It's more plastic soup than patch, however; there is no solid surface on which to stand. Most of it is made up of microplastics, plastics ground down into tiny bits by sunlight and wave action. Slat’s team of scientists say the garbage patch also contains an estimated 79,000 tons of abandoned fishing gear.
    </p>
    <p>Slat’s cleanup system has gone through several design changes. At first it was to be tethered to the ocean floor, but that scheme was scrapped in favor of the current design as a passive drifting system.Physically, the device consists of a high-density polyethylene pipe 4 feet in diameter and 1,969 feet long. It will rest on the ocean surface in the shape of a U, with a screen skirt that hangs below the surface. It moves slowly through the water, driven by currents and winds, and can capture plastics on the surface, as well as debris almost 10 feet below the surface. If the device performs as designed, 60 additional booms will be deployed.
    </p>
    <p>If everything goes as planned, it should collect 100,000 to 150,000 pounds of garbage in the first year. The full fleet of 60 devices—which will be larger—will collect more than 30 million pounds a year, Slat estimates.
    </p>
    <p>The final challenge, he says, is survivability. The Ocean Cleanup’s engineers designed the device to survive a 100-year storm event. And the design change that allows waves to run through the system means that it won’t have to absorb the destructive energy of waves.“Can it handle the worst conditions on the face of the planet? The ocean’s wind, waves, currents, salt, corrosion—all of these different destructive forces that are working against you. If by April we don’t sustain any significant damage, we can unpop a cork and celebrate,” Slat says</p>
    <h3>Current Update on The Ocean Cleanup</h3>
    <p>Update: The ocean cleanup contraption developed to collect plastic trash from the Pacific Garbage Patch is being towed back to San Francisco during the first week of January 2019 for repairs, after losing a 60-foot end piece. The break was discovered during a routine inspection and is believed to be caused by metal fatigue, though analysis is still underway.</p>

    <p>The 2,000-foot boom, known as Wilson, is the creation of Boyan Slat, the Dutch entrepreneur who launched it last September for a year-long series of tests. “We are of course quite bummed about this,” Slat tweeted. “At the same time, we also realize that setbacks like this are inevitable when pioneering new technology at a rapid pace.” He described the setback as “teething troubles” that are “solvable.” He also vowed that ”the cleanup of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch will be operational in 2019.”</p>
